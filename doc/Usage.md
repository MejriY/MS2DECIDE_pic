## Usage Guide: `K_estimation`

The `K_estimation` function is a core feature of the library designed to estimate \( K \)-values for compounds based on annotations from GNPS, ISDB, and Sirius. Below is a detailed explanation of how to use this function.

---

### **Overview**
The `K_estimation` function:
- Integrates annotation data from multiple sources: GNPS, ISDB, and Sirius.
- Processes user-provided input files such as quantitative data and MGF files.
- Generates a filtered dataframe based on the estimated \( K \)-values.
- Exports the results to a `.tsv` file for further analysis.

---

### **How to Use `K_estimation`**

1. **Input Credentials**
   - The function will prompt you to provide your GNPS username, password, and email. This is necessary for authenticating with the GNPS platform.

2. **Provide Input Files**
   - Specify the paths to the following required files:
     - **Quantitative Data File**: A `.csv` file containing the quantitative data for your analysis. Ensure the file format is correct to avoid errors.
     - **MGF File**: A file containing mass spectrometry data in MGF format.
     - **FBMN Title:** Provide a unique and descriptive title for your FBMN job. **Note**: A folder with this title will be created to upload the quantitative data and MGF file. Ensure the title you choose does not match the name of an existing folder.
   
   - Example paths:
     ```plaintext
     SELECT THE PATH FOR YOUR QUANTITATIVE FILE 
     : /path/to/quantitative_file.csv

     SELECT THE PATH FOR YOUR MGF FILE 
     : /path/to/mgf_file.mgf
     ```

4. **Set Up GNPS Workflow**
   - Choose the GNPS job title and the type of research:
     - `strict`: Uses a mass difference tolerance of 0.02 Da. For more precise information, we recommend visiting the [GNPS Documentation on Library Search](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/librarysearch/). **Note**: This workflow uses a Score Threshold of `0.001`.
     - `iterative`: Utilizes a weighted iterative GNPS analog search.

At this level, FBMN jobs will be create in your GNPS account. In the case of `strict`

4. **ISDB-Lotus Annotation**
   - The ISDB-Lotus annotation is performed using the function `isdb_res = get_cfm_annotation(mgf, ISDBtol)`. During the process, the user will be prompted to provide:
     - **Ionization Mode**: Specify the ionization mode for annotation (`POS` for positive, `NEG` for negative).
     - **Mass Tolerance**: Provide a mass tolerance value less than `0.5` (default: `0.02`). **Note**: This value is between 0 and 0.5.
   - This function calculates annotations by matching mass spectrometry data with ISDB-Lotus spectral data.

5. **Sirius Annotation**
   - Provide the path to the Sirius annotation file (`structure_identifications.tsv`).
   - Select the index score type:
     - `exact`
     - `approximate`

6. **Compile Results**
   - Results from GNPS, Sirius, and ISDB-LOTUS are compiled into a unified dataframe.
   - The dataframe is filtered and sorted by \( K \)-values.

7. **Export Results**
   - Specify the path to save the output `.tsv` file:
     ```plaintext
     SELECT THE SAVE PATH FOR THE .TSV FILE OF MS2DECIDE. 
     #This path needs to terminate with a file_name.tsv where `file_name` is the desired name specified by the user.
     ```

8. **Optional: Retrieve Empty Annotations in the case of GNPS iterative**
   - If requested (`yes`), the function generates a report of empty annotations and saves it as `empty.tsv`.

---

### **Return Value**
The function returns a (`tsv file`)containing the **processed** and **ranked** results.

---

### **Example Workflow**
Below is an example of how to call the `K_estimation` function in Python and interact with its prompts:

```python
from your_library import K_estimation

# Run the function to estimate K values
df = K_estimation()

# Output dataframe and file saved at specified path
print(df.head())
```

---

### **Notes**
- Ensure that your input files follow the required format (`.csv` for quantitative data, `.mgf` for mass spectrometry data).
- Ensure internet connectivity for accessing GNPS and related services.
- The save path for the `.tsv` file must have a valid `.tsv` extension and specify the desired file name (e.g., `/path/to/output_file.tsv`).

By following these steps, you can effectively use the `K_estimation` function to process and analyze your compound data.
